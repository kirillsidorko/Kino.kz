Select a Movie Date and Time: You can pick when you want to watch a movie from a set of predefined dates and times. Choose a Movie: There's a dropdown menu where you can select a movie you want to watch. Visual Seat Selection: Based on your movie, date, and time selection, you can choose seats. Selected seats will change color to show they're taken. Remember Your Choices: It remembers your selections (like the movie, date, and time you chose) for the next time you visit the page, using something called localStorage. This means if you come back to the page later, your last choices are already selected for you. Seat Availability in Real-Time: If someone else has booked a seat for the same show, it'll show up as taken when you're selecting seats, so you don't double-book a seat. Essentially, it's a basic movie booking system where you can pick a movie, a showtime, and select your seats, with the system keeping track of what's been selected across sessions.
